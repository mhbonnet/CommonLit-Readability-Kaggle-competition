# Kaggle8 repository
  
This repository contains different notebooks created for the kaggle competition : 'CommonLit Readability'.   
  
* In **'Full compare Projet 8'** notebook, you'll find a comparison between different regression models applied on the same features, extracted from text using pretrained DistilBert model.   
* The **'distilbert-for-regression'** notebook contains the first code submitted for the competition : features extracted with the DistilBert pretrained model and a ridge regression with a polynomial kernel.
