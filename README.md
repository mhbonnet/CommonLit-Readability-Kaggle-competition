# Kaggle8 repository - CommonLit Readability Kaggle competition
  
This repository contains different notebooks created for the Kaggle competition : [CommonLit Readability](https://www.kaggle.com/c/commonlitreadabilityprize).

For this competition, I tried two different approaches using DistilBert.   
  
In the first approach, I used Distilbert as a feature extractor, and the features were then given to regressors. Two notebooks concerns this approach :   
* In **'Full compare Projet 8'** notebook, you'll find a comparison between different regression models applied on the same features, extracted with the pretrained DistilBert model.   
* The **'distilbert-for-regression'** notebook contains the first code submitted for the competition : features extracted with the DistilBert pretrained model and a ridge regression.  
* The **'FINAL_CHOICE_distilbert-for-regression'** notebook contains the last submitted notebook, with a polynomial kernel regression. It obtained the best RMSE = 0.556 and it's my final choice for this project.    
  
In the second approach I build a composed pytorch model with Distilbert, dropout and linear layers. The code was originally copied from other notebooks (S Canisir et V Baskaran). I upgraded it in two steps, resulting is the two notebooks below, both submitted to the competition (best RMSE = 0.576).  
* **'commonlit-distilbert-all-in-one'** : RMSE and learning curves display 
* **'distilbert-fine-tuning-data-augmentation'** : data augmentation
  
All of these notebooks require the import af a distilbert-base-uncased dataset in Kaggle, in order to use pretrained model offline. The last notebook requires also the import of a nlpaug dataset to be used offline. These notebooks still need some further experimentations.   
    
The 'requirements.txt' file contains all the librairies available in the Kaggle envrionment for the submission to the competition.
